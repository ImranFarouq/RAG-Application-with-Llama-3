This heightened interest has led to a surge in sustainable \\ninvestments such as  ESG funds  and Green Bonds, as more and more investors \\nrecognise the significance of taking into account the financial and economic \\nramifications of  environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") issues when making \\ninvestment decisions. ESG factors also have an influence on a company\\'s capacity \\nto execute its business plan and produce value in the long run. ESG refers to the \\nfollowing:  \\n(a) Environmental:  This factor includes a company\\'s impact on the natural \\nenvironment, such as its carbon emissions, energy use, waste management, and \\nwater usage.  \\n(b) Social:  This factor encompasses a company\\'s impact on society, including its \\ntreatment of employees, customer relations, community engagement, and \\nhuman rights policies.  \\n(c) Governance:  This factor relates to a company\\'s internal management and \\noversight, including issues such as executive compensation, board diversity, \\nand transparency.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.2 ESG reporting is recognized as one of the diverse approaches accessible for \\nassessing the company\\'s overall performance. It offers insights into a company\\'s \\nperformance that extend beyond the information conveyed in financial statements. \\nInvestors and other stakeholders seeking to evaluate the long -term sustainability and \\nethical impact of companies’ operations use such information in their decision -\\nmaking process.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.3 Sustainability reporting and ESG are related but distinct concepts. ESG reports \\nconform to a more specific set of criteria that companies can measure and report \\nagainst, whereas sustainability reporting provides a wide -ranging overview of a \\ncompany\\'s sustainability initiatives, goals, and strategies, as well as its progress in \\nachieving them. While reporting on ESG metrics is important from a stakeholder \\nperspective, it is imperative that companies proactively implement strategies to \\nimprove environmental and social performance, and to ensure good governance \\npractices.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.4 The Central Bank of Bahrain (“CBB”) views that ESG reporting is an effective tool \\nfor stakeholders to better examine a company’s efficiency, sustainability, and risk \\nexposure. The objective of this Module  is to establish a uniform framework for \\nlisted companies and licensees to disclose their ESG performance and sustainability \\nefforts.  Considering  that companies are at different stages on their sustainability \\njourney, this document contains information on important aspects of ESG \\nreporting, such as stages involved in creating an ESG report, recommendations, \\nresources, and requirements when preparing the report. These topics collectively \\noffer a thorough approach to ESG reporting and are to be viewed in conjunction \\nwith relevant international best practices, frameworks and guidelines referred to \\nwithin this document (Appendix 2).  \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -A:   Introduction   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -A.1 Introduction and Scope (continued)  \\n \\nPurpose  \\n \\nESG -A.1.5 The objective of this Module  is to foster consistency and reliability in ESG \\nreporting, with the goal of facilitating the development of transparent and \\ncomparable ESG disclosures that align with both national and international targets \\nand commitments.  \\n \\nLegal Basis  \\n \\nESG -A.1.6 This Module contains the CBB’s Directive (as amended from time to \\ntime) relating to ESG requirements and is issued under the powers \\navailable to the CBB under Articles 38 and 65(b) of the Central Bank of \\nBahrain and Financial Institutions Law 2006 (‘CBB Law’).   \\n \\nScope  \\n \\nESG -A.1.7 This Module applies to the following companies:  \\n(a) Listed Companies ; \\n(b) Banks ; \\n(c) Insurance Firms ; \\n(d) Category 1 Investment Firms ; \\n(e) Category 2 Investment Firms ; and  \\n(f) Financing Companies . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -A:   Introduction   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -A.2 Module History  \\nEvolution of the Module  \\n \\nESG -A.2.1  This Module was first issued in November  2023.

The ESG report must  incorporate the ESG \\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) stipulated under Appendix 1.  The \\nESG report can either be a separate document or be included as part \\nof the company\\'s annual report.  \\n \\nESG -1.1.2 The branches of foreign financial institutions must  either submit the \\nESG Report of their respective head offices or provide a separate \\nreport.  Similarly,  companies operating under a group governance \\nframework must either submit the consolidated group ESG Report or \\nprovide a separate report.  \\n \\nESG -1.1.3 Listed companies and licensees must comply with the following \\nrequirements with respect to their ESG reports:  \\n(a) Disclosures must remain consistent over time. This entails using \\nconsistent formats, language, and metrics from one period to \\nanother to enable inter -period comparisons ; \\n(b) In cases where certain breakdowns are not easily discernible or \\nrelevant, alternative methods or simplified reporting mechanisms \\ncan be explored by the company. However, it is essential that the \\nreport adequately describes the mechanisms, assumptions, and \\nother relevant details ; \\n(c) Organisations must  refrain from providing generic or simplistic \\ndisclosures that offer little value. It is also important that any \\nadditional metrics are sufficiently descriptive ; \\n(d) Companies must avoid greenwashing1 their ESG reports. This \\ncan damage a company\\'s reputation and erode stakeholder trust. \\nAvoid making unsupported claims or using vague, undefined \\nterms such as \"green\" or \"sustainable\" and i nstead  provide \\nspecific and measurable information.  \\n(e) Provide definitions, reference period(s) and assumptions where \\nrelevant ; and  \\n(f) Provide an explanation in case of non - or partial disclosure of \\nKPIs stipulated under Appendix 1 . \\n \\n1 Greenwashing refers to the practice of making misleading or exaggerated claims about the environmental or social \\nbenefits of a product, service, or business practice . \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n  \\nMODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2.1 Listed companies and licensees must  have in place an adequate \\ngovernance framework and reporting process  for ESG reporting.  \\n \\nESG -1.2.3  A standardised set of ESG metrics with clear definitions and guidance is \\nadvantageous for companies that are commencing their sustainability reporting \\njourney (see diagram below).  \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2.4  The ESG reporting process should include the following steps:  \\n \\n(a) First: Understand the purpose and importance of ESGs  \\nA clear ‘ESG purpose’ should  be determined to help align reporting efforts \\nconsistent with overall business strategy. ESG reporting leads to several \\nbenefits, for example:  \\nRisk Management:  ESG factors can affect a company\\'s performance and \\nfuture viability. Companies can identify potential risks and opportunities by \\nassessing ESG factors.  \\nInvestor Attraction:  More investors are considering ESG factors in their \\ndecision -making process. A company clearly conveying comparable and \\nconsistent ESG performance can gain a competitive edge and attract more \\ninvestment.  \\nReputation Enhancement:  Companies that report on ESG can improve \\ntheir public image, fostering trust and loyalty among stakeholders.  \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\n(b) Second: Construct a working group     \\nEstablishing a cross -functional ESG team is one of the most crucial stages in \\ntaking the company’s ESG plan to the next level. This team includes members \\nfrom various departments (such as finance, legal, risk management, investor \\nrelations  etc.), to ensure a varied perspective and a comprehensive approach \\ntowards achieving the company’s sustainability and ESG reporting goals. Clear \\nownership should  be established with key authorities to ensure that \\nsustainability initiatives are prioritised and integrated into the company’s \\noverall strategy and operations.  The Board of Directors is responsible and \\naccountable for ensuring ESG reporting.  \\n \\nThe organisation should ideally construct a management -level committee to \\noversee sustainability objectives and goals. Where needed , expert advice should \\nbe sought.  \\n(c) Third: Understand the Reporting Frameworks  \\nThe company should identify the relevant ESG issues and data sources, set \\ntargets, and establish a reporting process to ensure accurate disclosure of ESG \\ninformation. The frameworks should be studied closely to determine which \\napproach to use for each KPI. It is encouraged that the working group begin \\nby reviewing the ESG issues raised in international reporting standards and \\nguidelines to establish boundaries.  \\n \\nDetailed guidance on what topics to report on, how to measure and report on \\nthem, and what best practices to follow are presented in international \\nframeworks/guidelines (see Appendix 2).  \\n(d) Fourth: Conduct a Materiality Assessment    \\nA key tool to prepare the company\\'s ESG report is conducting an ESG \\nmateriality assessment to identify and prioritise ESG issues relevant to the \\norganisation. Companies use the concept of materiality to guide their \\nsustainability strategic planning processes. A material sustainability issue is an \\neconomic, environmental, social or governance issue on which a company has \\nan impact or may be impacted by (both positive and negative). It may also be \\none that significantly influences the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. \\nMateriality analysis includes determining where your company\\'s value chain \\nmay generate externalities, its effects, and which issues, practices, and policies \\nare most essential to ESG goals.  \\n \\nAfter the company’s most important ESG risks and opportunities have been \\nidentified, the insights can be utilised to improve strategic planning and \\nreporting. Companies that focus on material ESG topics from a strategic \\nperspective may benefit in the long run, while those that focus on immaterial \\nelements may incur an implicit opportunity cost.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nMODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nIn the initial stages of materiality assessment, a company should i dentify its key \\nstakeholders. Building support from significant internal and external \\nstakeholders, while ensuring participation across all divisions and functions, \\nmaintains the objectivity and independence of the evaluation process.   \\n \\n \\n \\nFurthermore, it is imperative to establish robust data collection and \\nmanagement systems. The working group should develop a data collection \\nplan that outlines the metrics and indicators to be tracked, taking into account \\nboth quantitative and qualitative data sources, encompassing internal and \\nexternal data. The data collection process should prioritize accuracy, reliability, \\nand the absence of errors or inconsistencies in the collected information. This \\nentails implementing measures to verify the integrity of the data, ensure its \\naccuracy, and promptly address any discrepancies or issues that may surface. It \\nis also important to openly disclose any challenges or gaps encountered during \\nthe data collection process and provide a clear plan for addressing them.  \\n \\nMateriality Matrix  \\n \\nThe materiality  matrix  is a visual  tool used to identify  and prioritise  ESG  issues  \\nthat are most  relevant  to a company  and its stakeholders.  The following  is an \\nexample  of how to create  a materiality  matrix  for ESG  disclosures:    \\ni. Identify  the relevant  ESG  issues:  Start by identifying  the ESG  issues  \\nthat are pertinent  to the company\\'s  operations,  industry,  and stakeholders.  \\nThis can be done  through  a materiality  assessment,  which  involves  \\ngathering  input  from  internal  and external  stakeholders  as explained  above.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nii. Determine  the impact  and importance  of each  issue:  Evaluate  each \\nissue based  on its potential  impact  on the company\\'s  financial  \\nperformance,  reputation,  and stakeholders.   \\niii. Plot the issues  on a matrix:  Once  you have identified  and evaluated  the \\nESG  issues,  plot them  on a matrix  with two axes: impact  and importance.  \\nThe impact  axis measures  the potential  impact  of the issue on the \\ncompany\\'s  financial  performance  and reputation,  while  the importance  axis \\nmeasures  the issue\\'s  importance  to stakeholders.    \\niv. Categorise  the issues:  Plot the issues  into four quadrants:   \\n1. Material:  High impact  and high importance  issues  that should  be \\ndisclosed  in the company\\'s  ESG  report  and given  priority  in the \\ncompany\\'s  sustainability  strategy.   \\n2. Significant:  High impact  but lower importance  issues  that should  be \\nmonitored  and managed  but may not require  immediate  \\ndisclosure.   \\n3. Moderate:  Lower  impact  but high importance  issues  that should  be \\nmonitored  and managed  to maintain  stakeholder  trust and meet  \\nstakeholder  expectations.   \\n4. Minimal:  Lower  impact  and lower importance  issues  that may not \\nrequire  significant  attention  but should  still be monitored  for \\npotential  risks or opportunities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nSeveral resources are available to provide guidance on the creation of a \\nMateriality Matrix, such as Climate Disclosures Standards Board2 and the \\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board’s Materiality Map3.  \\n \\n(e) Fifth: Set Targets and Goals     \\nESG targets and goals should be specific, measurable, and associated with \\nthe overarching strategy of the company; they should also be quantitative \\nor directional.  Targets should also be regularly reviewed and updated to \\nensure they remain relevant and achievable.  \\n(f) Sixth: Reporting ESGs    \\nThe ESG report may begin by including a statement on the company’s \\nESG purpose, how ESGs are governed and the reporting boundary, to \\nallow readers to understand the scope of the report. Further, the company \\ncan explain its materiality determination process and stakeholders the \\ncompany has engaged with. The company should conclude by stating its \\ntargets and goals and how it aims to progress its ESG journey, as well as \\nhow this aligns with its corporate strategy.  \\n \\n2 https://www.cdsb.net/what -we-do/reporting -guidance/materiality   \\n \\n3 https://sasb.org/standards/materiality -map/  \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n Appendix 1 – ESG KPIs and Guidance  \\n \\nThe list provides the KPIs as well as guidance on how to report and disclose data for \\neach ESG aspect.

The \\norganisation was created in 1997 with the intention of supporting long -term development via \\ntransparency and accountability. The GRI Standards are classified into three series: Universal \\nStandards, Topic -specific Standards, and Sector -specific Standards. They provide a \\ncomprehensive set of disclosures across a range of sustainability topics, including governance, \\nlabour practices, human rights, environmental impacts, product responsibility, and community \\nengagement. The GRI Standards are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of \\ncompanies, industries, and geographic regions. The framework encourages companies to report \\nnot only on their positive sustainability performance but also on their challenges and areas for \\nimprovement. This helps to promote transparency and accountability and enables stakeholders to \\nmake informed decisions based on reliable and comparable information.   \\n \\nLink:   https://www.globalreporting.org/  \\n   \\n   \\nTask Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD):  The TCFD is a global \\nvoluntary framework that provides guidelines for companies to disclose climate -related financial \\nrisks and opportunities. Established by the Financial Stability Board, TCFD recommendations \\ncover four core areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The \\nTCFD recommendations are designed to be flexible and scalable to different types of companies \\nand industries. They are also intended to help companies identify and seize opportunities related \\nto the transition to a low -carbon economy.    \\n \\nLink:  http://www.fsb -tcfd.org/  \\n   \\n   \\nCDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project):  CDP is a global environmental impact non-\\nprofit that runs a disclosure system for companies to report on their environmental performance. \\nCDP focuses on climate change, water security, and deforestation, and provides a standardised \\nframework for companies to measure and manage their environmental impacts. It provides a \\nstandardised questionnaire that companies can use to report on their environmental impacts and \\nrisks, as well as their strategies for mitigating these impacts.    \\n \\nLink:   http://www.cdp.net/en  \\n   \\n \\nIntegrated Reporting Framework (IR):   A comprehensive view of an organisation\\'s strategy, \\ngovernance, performance, and prospects —including ESG factors —is offered by the IR \\nFramework. It encourages businesses to communicate how they are managing their stakeholder \\nrelationships as well as how they are creating value over the short, medium, and long term. The \\nIR Framework can be used in conjunction with other reporting frameworks, such as the GRI \\nStandards and the SASB Standards, and is intended to be adaptable to different types of \\ncompanies and industries.   \\n \\nLink:  http://www.integratedreporting.org/  \\n   \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB):  The SASB Standards are intended to \\nassist businesses in providing investors with financial material ESG information. The framework \\nfocuses on 77 sustainability issues that are particular to each industry and are most likely to \\ninfluence a company\\'s financial performance. Environment, social capital, human capital, \\nbusiness model and innovation, and leadership and governance are the five categories into which \\nthese subjects are divided. The SASB Standards offer guidance on how to incorporate ESG \\ninformation into financial reporting and are made to be compatible with frameworks like the \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).   \\n   \\nLink:  http://www.sasb.org/  \\n \\n \\nClimate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB):  The CDSB develops and publishes a set of \\nglobally recognised reporting standards called the Climate Change Reporting Framework. This \\nframework provides guidance on how companies can report on their climate -related risks and \\nopportunities in a clear, comprehensive, and consistent manner. The CDSB also provides \\nguidance on how companies can report on other ESG issues, such as their impact on natural \\nresources, social and human capital, and governance.   \\n   \\nLink:  https://www.cdsb.net/  \\n \\n \\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB):  An independent body established by \\nthe IFRS Foundation to develop global sustainability reporting standards.  The IFRS \\nSustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS SDS) provide a structured framework for companies \\nto disclose material sustainability information in a consistent and comparable manner, covering a \\nwide range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. IFRS S1 establishes \\ndisclosure requirements that allow companies to communicate sustainability -related risks and \\nopportunities to investors over the short, medium, and long term. Complementing this, IFRS S2 \\nprovides detailed guidelines for disclosing climate -related information and is meant to be used in \\nconjunction with IFRS S1. Together, these standards enhance companies\\' ability to provide \\ncomprehensive and relevant sustainability reporting, enabling investors to make well -informed \\ndecisions.  \\n \\nLink:  https://www.ifrs.org/   \\n '"

This heightened interest has led to a surge in sustainable \\ninvestments such as  ESG funds  and Green Bonds, as more and more investors \\nrecognise the significance of taking into account the financial and economic \\nramifications of  environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") issues when making \\ninvestment decisions. ESG factors also have an influence on a company\\'s capacity \\nto execute its business plan and produce value in the long run. ESG refers to the \\nfollowing:  \\n(a) Environmental:  This factor includes a company\\'s impact on the natural \\nenvironment, such as its carbon emissions, energy use, waste management, and \\nwater usage.  \\n(b) Social:  This factor encompasses a company\\'s impact on society, including its \\ntreatment of employees, customer relations, community engagement, and \\nhuman rights policies.  \\n(c) Governance:  This factor relates to a company\\'s internal management and \\noversight, including issues such as executive compensation, board diversity, \\nand transparency.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.2 ESG reporting is recognized as one of the diverse approaches accessible for \\nassessing the company\\'s overall performance. It offers insights into a company\\'s \\nperformance that extend beyond the information conveyed in financial statements. \\nInvestors and other stakeholders seeking to evaluate the long -term sustainability and \\nethical impact of companies’ operations use such information in their decision -\\nmaking process.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.3 Sustainability reporting and ESG are related but distinct concepts. ESG reports \\nconform to a more specific set of criteria that companies can measure and report \\nagainst, whereas sustainability reporting provides a wide -ranging overview of a \\ncompany\\'s sustainability initiatives, goals, and strategies, as well as its progress in \\nachieving them. While reporting on ESG metrics is important from a stakeholder \\nperspective, it is imperative that companies proactively implement strategies to \\nimprove environmental and social performance, and to ensure good governance \\npractices.  \\n \\nESG -A.1.4 The Central Bank of Bahrain (“CBB”) views that ESG reporting is an effective tool \\nfor stakeholders to better examine a company’s efficiency, sustainability, and risk \\nexposure. The objective of this Module  is to establish a uniform framework for \\nlisted companies and licensees to disclose their ESG performance and sustainability \\nefforts.  Considering  that companies are at different stages on their sustainability \\njourney, this document contains information on important aspects of ESG \\nreporting, such as stages involved in creating an ESG report, recommendations, \\nresources, and requirements when preparing the report. These topics collectively \\noffer a thorough approach to ESG reporting and are to be viewed in conjunction \\nwith relevant international best practices, frameworks and guidelines referred to \\nwithin this document (Appendix 2).  \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -A:   Introduction   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -A.1 Introduction and Scope (continued)  \\n \\nPurpose  \\n \\nESG -A.1.5 The objective of this Module  is to foster consistency and reliability in ESG \\nreporting, with the goal of facilitating the development of transparent and \\ncomparable ESG disclosures that align with both national and international targets \\nand commitments.  \\n \\nLegal Basis  \\n \\nESG -A.1.6 This Module contains the CBB’s Directive (as amended from time to \\ntime) relating to ESG requirements and is issued under the powers \\navailable to the CBB under Articles 38 and 65(b) of the Central Bank of \\nBahrain and Financial Institutions Law 2006 (‘CBB Law’).   \\n \\nScope  \\n \\nESG -A.1.7 This Module applies to the following companies:  \\n(a) Listed Companies ; \\n(b) Banks ; \\n(c) Insurance Firms ; \\n(d) Category 1 Investment Firms ; \\n(e) Category 2 Investment Firms ; and  \\n(f) Financing Companies . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -A:   Introduction   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -A.2 Module History  \\nEvolution of the Module  \\n \\nESG -A.2.1  This Module was first issued in November  2023.

The ESG report must  incorporate the ESG \\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) stipulated under Appendix 1.  The \\nESG report can either be a separate document or be included as part \\nof the company\\'s annual report.  \\n \\nESG -1.1.2 The branches of foreign financial institutions must  either submit the \\nESG Report of their respective head offices or provide a separate \\nreport.  Similarly,  companies operating under a group governance \\nframework must either submit the consolidated group ESG Report or \\nprovide a separate report.  \\n \\nESG -1.1.3 Listed companies and licensees must comply with the following \\nrequirements with respect to their ESG reports:  \\n(a) Disclosures must remain consistent over time. This entails using \\nconsistent formats, language, and metrics from one period to \\nanother to enable inter -period comparisons ; \\n(b) In cases where certain breakdowns are not easily discernible or \\nrelevant, alternative methods or simplified reporting mechanisms \\ncan be explored by the company. However, it is essential that the \\nreport adequately describes the mechanisms, assumptions, and \\nother relevant details ; \\n(c) Organisations must  refrain from providing generic or simplistic \\ndisclosures that offer little value. It is also important that any \\nadditional metrics are sufficiently descriptive ; \\n(d) Companies must avoid greenwashing1 their ESG reports. This \\ncan damage a company\\'s reputation and erode stakeholder trust. \\nAvoid making unsupported claims or using vague, undefined \\nterms such as \"green\" or \"sustainable\" and i nstead  provide \\nspecific and measurable information.  \\n(e) Provide definitions, reference period(s) and assumptions where \\nrelevant ; and  \\n(f) Provide an explanation in case of non - or partial disclosure of \\nKPIs stipulated under Appendix 1 . \\n \\n1 Greenwashing refers to the practice of making misleading or exaggerated claims about the environmental or social \\nbenefits of a product, service, or business practice . \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n  \\nMODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2.1 Listed companies and licensees must  have in place an adequate \\ngovernance framework and reporting process  for ESG reporting.  \\n \\nESG -1.2.3  A standardised set of ESG metrics with clear definitions and guidance is \\nadvantageous for companies that are commencing their sustainability reporting \\njourney (see diagram below).  \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2.4  The ESG reporting process should include the following steps:  \\n \\n(a) First: Understand the purpose and importance of ESGs  \\nA clear ‘ESG purpose’ should  be determined to help align reporting efforts \\nconsistent with overall business strategy. ESG reporting leads to several \\nbenefits, for example:  \\nRisk Management:  ESG factors can affect a company\\'s performance and \\nfuture viability. Companies can identify potential risks and opportunities by \\nassessing ESG factors.  \\nInvestor Attraction:  More investors are considering ESG factors in their \\ndecision -making process. A company clearly conveying comparable and \\nconsistent ESG performance can gain a competitive edge and attract more \\ninvestment.  \\nReputation Enhancement:  Companies that report on ESG can improve \\ntheir public image, fostering trust and loyalty among stakeholders.  \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\n(b) Second: Construct a working group     \\nEstablishing a cross -functional ESG team is one of the most crucial stages in \\ntaking the company’s ESG plan to the next level. This team includes members \\nfrom various departments (such as finance, legal, risk management, investor \\nrelations  etc.), to ensure a varied perspective and a comprehensive approach \\ntowards achieving the company’s sustainability and ESG reporting goals. Clear \\nownership should  be established with key authorities to ensure that \\nsustainability initiatives are prioritised and integrated into the company’s \\noverall strategy and operations.  The Board of Directors is responsible and \\naccountable for ensuring ESG reporting.  \\n \\nThe organisation should ideally construct a management -level committee to \\noversee sustainability objectives and goals. Where needed , expert advice should \\nbe sought.  \\n(c) Third: Understand the Reporting Frameworks  \\nThe company should identify the relevant ESG issues and data sources, set \\ntargets, and establish a reporting process to ensure accurate disclosure of ESG \\ninformation. The frameworks should be studied closely to determine which \\napproach to use for each KPI. It is encouraged that the working group begin \\nby reviewing the ESG issues raised in international reporting standards and \\nguidelines to establish boundaries.  \\n \\nDetailed guidance on what topics to report on, how to measure and report on \\nthem, and what best practices to follow are presented in international \\nframeworks/guidelines (see Appendix 2).  \\n(d) Fourth: Conduct a Materiality Assessment    \\nA key tool to prepare the company\\'s ESG report is conducting an ESG \\nmateriality assessment to identify and prioritise ESG issues relevant to the \\norganisation. Companies use the concept of materiality to guide their \\nsustainability strategic planning processes. A material sustainability issue is an \\neconomic, environmental, social or governance issue on which a company has \\nan impact or may be impacted by (both positive and negative). It may also be \\none that significantly influences the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. \\nMateriality analysis includes determining where your company\\'s value chain \\nmay generate externalities, its effects, and which issues, practices, and policies \\nare most essential to ESG goals.  \\n \\nAfter the company’s most important ESG risks and opportunities have been \\nidentified, the insights can be utilised to improve strategic planning and \\nreporting. Companies that focus on material ESG topics from a strategic \\nperspective may benefit in the long run, while those that focus on immaterial \\nelements may incur an implicit opportunity cost.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nMODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nIn the initial stages of materiality assessment, a company should i dentify its key \\nstakeholders. Building support from significant internal and external \\nstakeholders, while ensuring participation across all divisions and functions, \\nmaintains the objectivity and independence of the evaluation process.   \\n \\n \\n \\nFurthermore, it is imperative to establish robust data collection and \\nmanagement systems. The working group should develop a data collection \\nplan that outlines the metrics and indicators to be tracked, taking into account \\nboth quantitative and qualitative data sources, encompassing internal and \\nexternal data. The data collection process should prioritize accuracy, reliability, \\nand the absence of errors or inconsistencies in the collected information. This \\nentails implementing measures to verify the integrity of the data, ensure its \\naccuracy, and promptly address any discrepancies or issues that may surface. It \\nis also important to openly disclose any challenges or gaps encountered during \\nthe data collection process and provide a clear plan for addressing them.  \\n \\nMateriality Matrix  \\n \\nThe materiality  matrix  is a visual  tool used to identify  and prioritise  ESG  issues  \\nthat are most  relevant  to a company  and its stakeholders.  The following  is an \\nexample  of how to create  a materiality  matrix  for ESG  disclosures:    \\ni. Identify  the relevant  ESG  issues:  Start by identifying  the ESG  issues  \\nthat are pertinent  to the company\\'s  operations,  industry,  and stakeholders.  \\nThis can be done  through  a materiality  assessment,  which  involves  \\ngathering  input  from  internal  and external  stakeholders  as explained  above.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nii. Determine  the impact  and importance  of each  issue:  Evaluate  each \\nissue based  on its potential  impact  on the company\\'s  financial  \\nperformance,  reputation,  and stakeholders.   \\niii. Plot the issues  on a matrix:  Once  you have identified  and evaluated  the \\nESG  issues,  plot them  on a matrix  with two axes: impact  and importance.  \\nThe impact  axis measures  the potential  impact  of the issue on the \\ncompany\\'s  financial  performance  and reputation,  while  the importance  axis \\nmeasures  the issue\\'s  importance  to stakeholders.    \\niv. Categorise  the issues:  Plot the issues  into four quadrants:   \\n1. Material:  High impact  and high importance  issues  that should  be \\ndisclosed  in the company\\'s  ESG  report  and given  priority  in the \\ncompany\\'s  sustainability  strategy.   \\n2. Significant:  High impact  but lower importance  issues  that should  be \\nmonitored  and managed  but may not require  immediate  \\ndisclosure.   \\n3. Moderate:  Lower  impact  but high importance  issues  that should  be \\nmonitored  and managed  to maintain  stakeholder  trust and meet  \\nstakeholder  expectations.   \\n4. Minimal:  Lower  impact  and lower importance  issues  that may not \\nrequire  significant  attention  but should  still be monitored  for \\npotential  risks or opportunities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n MODULE  ESG :  Environmental, Social and Governance  Requirements  \\nCHAPTER  ESG -1:   Reporting Requirements   \\n \\n \\n \\nESG -1.2 ESG Reporting Process  (continued)  \\n \\nSeveral resources are available to provide guidance on the creation of a \\nMateriality Matrix, such as Climate Disclosures Standards Board2 and the \\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board’s Materiality Map3.  \\n \\n(e) Fifth: Set Targets and Goals     \\nESG targets and goals should be specific, measurable, and associated with \\nthe overarching strategy of the company; they should also be quantitative \\nor directional.  Targets should also be regularly reviewed and updated to \\nensure they remain relevant and achievable.  \\n(f) Sixth: Reporting ESGs    \\nThe ESG report may begin by including a statement on the company’s \\nESG purpose, how ESGs are governed and the reporting boundary, to \\nallow readers to understand the scope of the report. Further, the company \\ncan explain its materiality determination process and stakeholders the \\ncompany has engaged with. The company should conclude by stating its \\ntargets and goals and how it aims to progress its ESG journey, as well as \\nhow this aligns with its corporate strategy.  \\n \\n2 https://www.cdsb.net/what -we-do/reporting -guidance/materiality   \\n \\n3 https://sasb.org/standards/materiality -map/  \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n Appendix 1 – ESG KPIs and Guidance  \\n \\nThe list provides the KPIs as well as guidance on how to report and disclose data for \\neach ESG aspect.

The \\norganisation was created in 1997 with the intention of supporting long -term development via \\ntransparency and accountability. The GRI Standards are classified into three series: Universal \\nStandards, Topic -specific Standards, and Sector -specific Standards. They provide a \\ncomprehensive set of disclosures across a range of sustainability topics, including governance, \\nlabour practices, human rights, environmental impacts, product responsibility, and community \\nengagement. The GRI Standards are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of \\ncompanies, industries, and geographic regions. The framework encourages companies to report \\nnot only on their positive sustainability performance but also on their challenges and areas for \\nimprovement. This helps to promote transparency and accountability and enables stakeholders to \\nmake informed decisions based on reliable and comparable information.   \\n \\nLink:   https://www.globalreporting.org/  \\n   \\n   \\nTask Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD):  The TCFD is a global \\nvoluntary framework that provides guidelines for companies to disclose climate -related financial \\nrisks and opportunities. Established by the Financial Stability Board, TCFD recommendations \\ncover four core areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The \\nTCFD recommendations are designed to be flexible and scalable to different types of companies \\nand industries. They are also intended to help companies identify and seize opportunities related \\nto the transition to a low -carbon economy.    \\n \\nLink:  http://www.fsb -tcfd.org/  \\n   \\n   \\nCDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project):  CDP is a global environmental impact non-\\nprofit that runs a disclosure system for companies to report on their environmental performance. \\nCDP focuses on climate change, water security, and deforestation, and provides a standardised \\nframework for companies to measure and manage their environmental impacts. It provides a \\nstandardised questionnaire that companies can use to report on their environmental impacts and \\nrisks, as well as their strategies for mitigating these impacts.    \\n \\nLink:   http://www.cdp.net/en  \\n   \\n \\nIntegrated Reporting Framework (IR):   A comprehensive view of an organisation\\'s strategy, \\ngovernance, performance, and prospects —including ESG factors —is offered by the IR \\nFramework. It encourages businesses to communicate how they are managing their stakeholder \\nrelationships as well as how they are creating value over the short, medium, and long term. The \\nIR Framework can be used in conjunction with other reporting frameworks, such as the GRI \\nStandards and the SASB Standards, and is intended to be adaptable to different types of \\ncompanies and industries.   \\n \\nLink:  http://www.integratedreporting.org/  \\n   \\n \\n Central Bank of Bahrain  \\nRulebook  Common Volume   \\n \\n \\n Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB):  The SASB Standards are intended to \\nassist businesses in providing investors with financial material ESG information. The framework \\nfocuses on 77 sustainability issues that are particular to each industry and are most likely to \\ninfluence a company\\'s financial performance. Environment, social capital, human capital, \\nbusiness model and innovation, and leadership and governance are the five categories into which \\nthese subjects are divided. The SASB Standards offer guidance on how to incorporate ESG \\ninformation into financial reporting and are made to be compatible with frameworks like the \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).   \\n   \\nLink:  http://www.sasb.org/  \\n \\n \\nClimate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB):  The CDSB develops and publishes a set of \\nglobally recognised reporting standards called the Climate Change Reporting Framework. This \\nframework provides guidance on how companies can report on their climate -related risks and \\nopportunities in a clear, comprehensive, and consistent manner. The CDSB also provides \\nguidance on how companies can report on other ESG issues, such as their impact on natural \\nresources, social and human capital, and governance.   \\n   \\nLink:  https://www.cdsb.net/  \\n \\n \\nInternational Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB):  An independent body established by \\nthe IFRS Foundation to develop global sustainability reporting standards.  The IFRS \\nSustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS SDS) provide a structured framework for companies \\nto disclose material sustainability information in a consistent and comparable manner, covering a \\nwide range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. IFRS S1 establishes \\ndisclosure requirements that allow companies to communicate sustainability -related risks and \\nopportunities to investors over the short, medium, and long term. Complementing this, IFRS S2 \\nprovides detailed guidelines for disclosing climate -related information and is meant to be used in \\nconjunction with IFRS S1. Together, these standards enhance companies\\' ability to provide \\ncomprehensive and relevant sustainability reporting, enabling investors to make well -informed \\ndecisions.  \\n \\nLink:  https://www.ifrs.org/']"
